<p>After installation 
<small><a href="doc.html#InstallingOpenSteer">[see doc section
"Installing OpenSteer"]</a></small> change to the <b>opensteer</b>
directory and run the <b>steertest</b> command.  The application will
open a single window labeled "SteerTest". SteerTest has a single
<i>selected</i> vehicle which the camera normally tracks.  The user
can select another vehicle by clicking on it with the left mouse
button.  SteerTest recognizes several single key commands:</p>


<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="90%" align=center>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox width="25%">Tab</td>
<td class=titlebox>select next PlugIn</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>r</td>
<td class=titlebox>restart current PlugIn</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>s</td>
<td class=titlebox>select next vehicle/agent/character&nbsp; 
                   (or mouse-click to select)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>c</td>
<td class=titlebox>select next camera aiming mode</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>f</td>
<td class=titlebox>select next preset frame rate&nbsp;
                   (as-fast-as-possible, 24fps, 60fps)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>Space</td>
<td class=titlebox>toggle between Run and Pause</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>-> &nbsp; (right arrow)</td>
<td class=titlebox>step forward one frame</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>?</td>
<td class=titlebox>print "mini help" on console&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>Esc</td>
<td class=titlebox>exit SteerTest</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The camera (or "point of view") in SteerTest is typically
controlled so that it tracks the selected vehicle.  Several different
camera aiming modes are provided:</p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="90%" align=center>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox width="25%">static</td>
<td class=titlebox>fixed camera</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>fixed&nbsp;distance&nbsp;offset&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td class=titlebox>
camera remains a fixed distance from selected vehicle
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>fixed local offset</td>
<td class=titlebox>
camera remains fixed in selected vehicle's local space
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>straight down</td>
<td class=titlebox>
camera looks at selected vehicle from directly above
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class=titlebox>offset POV</td>
<td class=titlebox>
camera looks in selected vehicle's forward direction, from a given
offset in the vehicle's local space
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>You can adjust the camera's view with the mouse: hold down the
keyboard's <i>control </i>(Ctrl) key while dragging the mouse with its
left button held down.  2D mouse motion is mapped into the camera's
space, rotating the camera's position around its aimpoint.  This
allows the camera to move on the surface of a sphere centered at the
aimpoint.  The radius of this sphere--<wbr>the "viewing
distance"--<wbr>can be adjusted by dragging the mouse with the middle
button held down (vertical mouse motion maps to distance).  If you use
a one- or two-button mouse (hence no middle button) you can adjust the
radius by holding down both the Ctrl and Alt ("control-meta-") keys
while dragging the mouse with its left button held down.</p>



<p>Sample PlugIns:

<b>Capture the Flag:</b> a single (bluish) attacker attempts to reach
a central goal while four (reddish) defenders try to intercept ("tag")
the attacker before it gets to the goal.  Press F1 to add an obstacle
(up to 100 of them), F2 to remove one. <b>Pedestrians:</b> 70 agents
follow a path (the red line) while avoiding collisions with each other
and two large spherical obstacles.  They also wander as they move.
Press F1 to toggle the wander component on and off. <b>Boids:</b> 100
simulated flocking "bird like objects". <b>Multiple Pursuit:</b> a
"test fixture" for the <i>pursue</i> behavior.  30 pursuers chase one
wandering quarry. <b>Low Speed Turn:</b> a "test fixture" for
evaluating the response of a vehicle to backward-pointing steering
force while moving at low speed. <b>One Turning Away:</b> this is the
first one, I'm just keeping it for old time sake right now.</p>
